# Periodic notes - reqs
Periodic notes that are linked. Automatically generated todo lists for daily, weekly and monthly notes using the Tasks plugin.
Daily and weekly notes can be created from the Calendar plugin. I create other notes manually and move them to their respective folders, or click the link in one of the notes and that creates the note in the correct folder.

- 2023-11-17 
	- Changed the folder structure for periodic notes.
	- Changed the template for the Daily note so that clicking the links for Yesterday, Week, Tomorrow creates files in the appropriate folders
	- Daily notes are created in Periodic_notes/YYYY/MM-MMM (example: Periodic_notes/2023/11-Nov/2023-11-17)
	- Weekly notes are created in Periodic_notes/Weekly
	- I move other notes manually

- Start of the week needs to be monday in order for weekly note to link correctly to days of the week. I used Calendar plugin for that but maybe there's some other way.
